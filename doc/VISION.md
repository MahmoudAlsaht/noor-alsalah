# Project Vision & Goals

## The Vision
To build a **highly accurate, privacy-focused, and distraction-free** prayer companion for personal and family use. The app serves not just as a calendar, but as a spiritual assistant that encourages commitment to prayers and Quran reading.

## Core Goals
1.  **Unquestionable Accuracy**: Matches the Official Jordan Ministry of Awqaf times 100%. No "approximate" times.
2.  **Privacy First**: No tracking, no external servers, no ads. All data (prayer records, Quran progress) lives on the user's device.
3.  **Simplicity**: A clean, "Premium" interface that does one thing perfectly. No clutter.
4.  **Resilience**: Works offline, handles DST changes automatically (via system time), and is always available (PWA).

## Target Audience
- **Primary**: The Developer and their family.
- **Needs**: Accuracy, Reminders, and Tracking.
